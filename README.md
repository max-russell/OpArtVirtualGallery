# Op Art Virtual Gallery

This was an assignment in the second year of my Creative Computing degree. It is a Processing sketch allowing the user to wander around a virtual art gallery, featuring abstract pieces inspired by the 1960s works of artist Bridget Riley. As the user faces each artwork on the wall, a transformation takes place, seamlessly transporting the user to another part of the gallery.
